    "In the previous notebook, you learnt about the segmentation problem and explored the data. In this notebook, you will learn how Deep Learning, a form of Machine Learning, can be used to predict the tumor regions on the MRI scans similar to radiologists. To get you started, we have trained the state-of-the-art U-Net architecture to develop a model for segmenting tumor."

Four such modules make up the encoder. The decoder consists of four modules of Conv2DTranspose layers followed by Concatenate layers. The network performs slice-wise (2D) segmentation with multi-modal MRI scans provided as the input."

    "Models were trained with Dice Loss function for 100 epochs on 8 GPUs. Adam optimizer (Kingma, 2015) was used with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 128. Data augmentation was used while training each of the models to improve generalization. This consisted of random rotations (0–25° degrees range), random zooming (value = 0.2, zooms image by 80–120% range), width shift (value = 0.2, horizontal translation of images by 0.2 percent), height shift (value = 0.2, vertical translation of images by 0.2 percent), shear (value = 0.2, clips the image in counter-clockwise direction) and random horizontal flips."
